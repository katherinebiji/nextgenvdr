# 📂 Next Gen VDR (Virtual Data Room)  
**AI-Powered Diligence & Collaboration for the Next Generation of Deals**  

---

## 📌 Overview  
This project was built during **Cerebral Valley’s NYC 2025 Hackathon**, reimagining the **Virtual Data Room (VDR)** for tomorrow’s dealmakers. Our solution augments the traditional VDR with **AI-powered Q&A management, document intelligence, and workflow automation** — making due diligence faster, smarter, and more secure.  

---

## 🧩 Problem  
- Existing VDRs (Intralinks, Datasite, etc.) focus on file storage but **don’t reduce the manual burden of Q&A, categorization, and relevance checking**.  
- Analysts and bankers waste hours triaging buyer questions, tagging documents, and chasing down internal teams.  
- Buyers often receive **slow, fragmented responses** that delay deals and increase transaction costs.  

---

## 💡 Our Solution  
Tomorrow’s VDR introduces **AI as a first-class participant** in the diligence process:  

- **🔎 Smart Question Management**  
  - Buyers upload questions (CSV, Word, Excel).  
  - AI auto-tags categories (legal, financial, commercial, HR, etc.) for routing.  

- **📂 Document Relevance Engine**  
  - Seller uploads documents.  
  - AI matches them to outstanding buyer questions across multiple buyers.  
  - Flags irrelevant uploads (wrong company / off-topic docs).

- **⚡ Real-Time Diligence Tracker**  
  - Unified seller-side view of all buyer Q&A.  
  - Tracks status, responsible team, and outstanding requests.  

- **🛡️ Deal-Ready UX**  
  - Banker-friendly interface with sticky tables, pill badges, and priority sorting.  
  - Mirrors workflows of top VDRs but with built-in AI copilots.

## 👥 End Users

- **Corporate Sellers** → less back-and-forth, fewer missed questions.
